# Send Message API Class (pinvoke)
Sends the specified message to a window or windows. 

It uses P/Invoke  that allows you to access structs, callbacks, and functions in unmanaged libraries from your managed code. 

## SendMessage function
The SendMessage function calls the window procedure for the specified window and does not return until the window procedure has processed the message.
```cs
SendMessage (int hwnd, int wMsg, int wParam, int lParam); 
```
### Parameters
#### hWnd
Type: HWND

> A handle to the window whose window procedure will receive the message. If this parameter is HWND_BROADCAST ((HWND)0xffff), the message is sent to all top-level windows in the system, including disabled or invisible unowned windows, overlapped windows, and pop-up windows; but the message is not sent to child windows.

Message sending is subject to UIPI. The thread of a process can send messages only to message queues of threads in processes of lesser or equal integrity level.

#### Msg
Type: UINT

> The message to be sent.
For lists of the system-provided messages, see System-Defined Messages.

#### wParam
Type: WPARAM
> Additional message-specific information.

#### lParam
Type: LPARAM
> Additional message-specific information.
